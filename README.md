Summary
Based on the listed key information, UCO requests us to find out: 
What is the most profitable way to sell cars online in USA market? This may include:
- Saturation in the market

- What types of colors are popular

 Which type of cars are most listed

 Which state is the most potential market?
The top 3 potential market is California, Florida, and New York State. These top 3 states are occupied one-third of the total listed vehicles. Geographically, the states located on the western and eastern coasts will be considered the better potential markets than inland areas. The Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.89 between the population in 2022 and the total listed vehicles tell us the strong relationship and the states with larger population may be better potential markets but it will not be necessary to consider the population density of states.
